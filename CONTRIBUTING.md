# Contributing
Simply fork, modify and then open a pull request.

## Here are some ideas

### Must have
 - More levels

 ### Should have
 - Fixes for possible browser/devices issues
 - More optimizations and better performance

 ### Could have
  - Simple sounds effects (under MIT license)
  - Improved design, colors and graphics
  - Better visual indications without killing performance
  - Level designer
  - Some tests
  - Smarter (offline) caching
  - Using SASS to generate the CSS
  - Creating an iOS/Android (hybrid) app
  - Better documentation, like for the level json format
  - And just general fixes for my web development stupidity :)

 ### Won't have
  - Can't think of anything now

### Submitting a level
If you want to submit a level it is enough to drop it in the levels/test/ folder with a unique filename without defining it in the levels.js file. You can just do it on the master branch and create a pull request. I will play test your level and put it in the appropriate place if it is good enough.

### House rules
  - Please have large/complicated modifications on a separate branch
  - Try to keep all frontend dependences to a minimal, no jQuery!
  - Preferably use only npm scripts and not Gulp, Grunt etc.
  - Write JavaScript in ECMAScript 6
  - Please use 2-space indentation
  - Make sure the game works well before making a pull request
  - Test on more than one browser/device
